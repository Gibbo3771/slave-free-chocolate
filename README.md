# Slave Free Chocolate API - current 0.2.0

The Slave Free Chocolate API (SFC) is a free to use resource for people out there who want to get data about a companies chocolate.

The idea is heavily inspired by [Slave Free Chocolate](http://www.slavefreechocolate.org/ethical-chocolate-companies) which is an information portal putting forward the issue of ethically (or rather, lack of) sources Cacao. The website contains a short list which I recommend you have a look at, be warned it will make you *want* chocolate...

This API implements that list into it's dataset and is the starting point of what is hopefully a much larger project.

You can access the API at [this link](https://slave-free-chocolate.herokuapp.com/) but beware, I am far from a designer for the landing page!
